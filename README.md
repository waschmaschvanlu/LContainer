# LContainer
a small script i made for someone that asked me in PN

it will create containers in a random zone that can be opened when an item is in the inventory (ESX)

needs ox-lib to work! :) 
and oxmysql. 
and es_extended,
and your sanity to function.

its NOWHERE near done. its just a rough mashup i made in about 2-3 hours

alot of stuff is missing like containers syncing between clients and it will spawn containers **per** client. which is inteded because i was to lazy to code a whole syncing thing..

this is just a rough idea.
