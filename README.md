# LContainer
a small script i made for someone that asked me in PN

it will create containers in a random zone that can be opened when an item is in the inventory (ESX)

needs ox-lib to work! :) 
and oxmysql. 
and es_extended,
and your sanity to function.

its NOWHERE near done. its just a rough mashup i made in about 2-3 hours

alot of stuff is missing like containers syncing between clients and it will spawn containers **per** client. which is inteded because i was to lazy to code a whole syncing thing..

 fun fact:
 MOST OF THE TIME WAS USED GETTING THIS DAMN ANIMATION TO WORK 
 because 0% of information online exists about synced anmations and you have to get them from the wierdest places on earth. 
 i had to search the gta 5 source files to find how this animation worked. 

 and the bag still dissapears, im not sure why. but i like it this way. and i was tired after being awake at 5 am finshing this script


this is just a rough idea.
